# Total-Recall
This program is something I wrote for my military squadron. It supports an unlimited amount of users to be added to the systems directory.

The purpose is to allow mass communication with little to no effort after the initial setup. So far you can only manually update the address book, but eventually you should be able to upload a csv file to add contacts.
